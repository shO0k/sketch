# sketch README
Scenario: A user is looking for a specific file on their hard drive (or image on the web), but can only remember a hint of an image within the file (symbol, logo, seal of approval, award ribbon, etc). 
This model will take a (low-fidelity) user-generated sketch and match it with imagisitc components of files on their hard drive. The output will be a list of the highest probability matches, helping to narrow the search space.
